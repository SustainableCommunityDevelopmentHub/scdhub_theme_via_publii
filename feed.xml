<div class="entry-content">
<p>The debate still goes on: should I keep my cat indoors or outdoors? Or maybe I should allow my cat both? This article will explain the pros and cons of both ideas and finally put an end to this dispute.</p>
<p><strong>To start off, these are the factors that outdoor cats live with:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An outdoor cat’s life expectancy is less than five years.</li>
<li>If your cat ventures into traffic on nearby roads/highways, it can result in it getting injured or fatally wounded.</li>
<li>There are potential poisonous items outside such as pesticides, chemicals, poisonous plants, etc.</li>
<li>Danger of contracting diseases such as Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia (FeLV) which are transmitted from an infected cat to another.</li>
<li>Can pick up parasites, fleas, paralysis ticks and ringworm – some of which are fatal if untreated or can be passed to humans.</li>
<li>Dogs, wild animals, possums, snakes and even nasty individuals can cause harm to cats.</li>
<li>More prone to getting lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Susceptible to skin cancer.</li>
<li>Get adequate exercise.</li>
<li>Promote mental health as cats can occupy themselves by exploring.</li>
<li>Claws are a cat’s way of defending themselves and if they are fully declawed, then the outdoors is not recommended unless they’re fully supervised.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Factors to consider for indoor cats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can live for twelve to twenty years plus.</li>
<li>Less likely to get into fights with other animals, get hurt by vehicles or contract illnesses.</li>
<li>Your cat will need your assistance to get enough exercise and be healthy.</li>
<li>Indoor cats can become clingy when owners are home and stressed out when not.</li>
<li>Even with scratching posts, some cats still like your furniture over their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors above show you that perhaps the best of both worlds is required. Cats can be leash trained so they can be walked much like a dog. This is good exercise for both owner and pet. A cat enclosure is also a good idea as it allows cats to enjoy the outdoors in safety. It simply offers protection and keeps the cat from wandering away. It should be large enough for the cat to move freely around in, have climbing options and a shaded rest area. So now you can let your cat enjoy both the indoors and outdoors!</p>

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
